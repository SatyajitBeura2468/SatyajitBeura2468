# Namaste, I'm Satyajit Beura! 🙏
### 🔭 Independent Researcher | Class 11 Survivor | OAVS Musiguda

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I am technically a **Class 11 Science student**, which means my life is 40% assignments, 40% worrying about Boards, and 20% trying to simulate the Universe on my laptop before my mom catches me awake at 2 AM.

My goal? To crack the code of reality (and hopefully NEET/JEE) without losing my sanity.

## 🧠 Things Keep Me Awake at Night (My Research)

### 1. Algorithmic Convergent Evolution (ACE Theory) 🧬 *[Current Obsession]*
My latest theory. I’m basically asking: **"Does the Universe have a favorite source code?"**
* I'm trying to prove that evolution isn't just random luck, but a fundamental algorithm that nature uses to optimize everything—from biological cells to cosmic structures. It’s heavy stuff, but someone’s gotta do it.

### 2. Dimensional Memory Encoding (DME Model) 🌌
This is where I try to mix **Quantum Mechanics** with **Psychology**.
* The core idea: What if our memories aren't just stored in neurons, but encoded across higher spatial dimensions? (Yes, thinking about this hurts my brain too).

### 3. Project Tejas-Vayu 🍃 *[Built it!]*
Because Bhawanipatna heat is real, and pollution is worse.
* I built an **AI-driven simulation** for "Pollution Eating Paint" using $TiO_2$ photocatalysis. It’s my attempt at making Smart Cities actually smart.

## 📂 Proof That I Actually Work
If you want to see the serious, "professional" side of me (so my teachers don't scold me):

* **📜 My Published Research:** [Read my Papers here](https://osf.io/qjy3g/)
* **💻 The Lab (Portfolio):** [Check out my simulations](https://satyajitbeura2468.github.io/)

## ⚡ Technical Arsenal
* **Physics:** Thermodynamics & Fluid Dynamics (My love-hate relationship).
* **Code:** HTML/JS (Three.js), Python (The snake that helps me build things).
* **Fuel:** Curiosity, Late Night Snacks, and the fear of an unfulfilled potential.
