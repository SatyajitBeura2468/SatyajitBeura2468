# Hey, This is Satyajit Beura! 🙏
### 🔭 Independent Researcher | Class 11 Survivor | OAVS Musiguda

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I am technically a **Class 11 Science student**, which means my life is 40% assignments, 40% worrying about Boards, and 20% trying to simulate the Universe on my laptop before my mom catches me awake at 2 AM.

My goal? To crack the code of reality, without losing my sanity.

## 🧠 Things Keep Me Awake at Night (My Research)

### 1. Algorithmic Convergent Evolution (ACE Theory) 🧬 *[Current Obsession]*
My latest theory. I’m basically asking: **"Does the Universe have a favorite source code?"**
* I'm trying to prove that evolution isn't just random luck, but a fundamental algorithm that nature uses to optimize everything—from biological cells to cosmic structures. It’s heavy stuff, but someone’s gotta do it.
* **[Read the ACE Theory](https://zenodo.org/records/18138541?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjY1MDA0MTA0LTUyYjAtNGFmZS1iYTQxLWExY2Q1MTEwNjcyZCIsImRhdGEiOnt9LCJyYW5kb20iOiI4OTM5NDE0YTMwYTU5ZGI3YmZmNzg1ZWIxNmU2NmNhNyJ9.dAhQfpkLTjSGWpnh7TNyhpLEnqD4cGgCSqdnwS95FaVl7c_ajcP-5E9odWq25YA2QXaogJ5eymE5LSHyNs0M0A)**

### 2. Dimensional Memory Encoding (DME Model) 🌌
This is where I try to mix **Quantum Mechanics** with **Psychology**.
* The core idea: What if our memories aren't just stored in neurons, but encoded across higher spatial dimensions? (Yes, thinking about this hurts my brain too).
* **[Read the DME Paper](https://zenodo.org/records/17943112?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpZCI6Ijg5M2Y3YmMyLWIwZjEtNGJkNy1hMTI4LWQzYTFmMGQ2ZWFlNSIsImRhdGEiOnt9LCJyYW5kb20iOiIzOGNjMGM2ODA1ZTkyOTI0MDY0NzU5NzE4OTEzMDY2NSJ9.LbO3ssieaTGTSEQG7V7tW_X5sEzz_5lXoy0qbITDjZt-UqpyA12XDoMsehY-I0ZeHBtOipA-hLx6KQHCP37UVg)**

### 3. Project Tejas-Vayu 🍃 *[Built it!]*
Because Bhawanipatna heat is real, and pollution is worse.
* I built an **AI-driven simulation** for "Pollution Eating Paint" using $TiO_2$ photocatalysis. It’s my attempt at making Smart Cities actually smart.

## ⚡ Technical Arsenal
* **Physics:** Thermodynamics & Fluid Dynamics (My love-hate relationship).
* **Code:** HTML/JS (Three.js), Python (The snake that helps me build things).
* **Fuel:** Curiosity, Late Night Snacks, and the fear of an unfulfilled potential.

> *"Trying to do better. One equation at a time."*
