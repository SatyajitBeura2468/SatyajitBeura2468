### Hi, I'm Satyajit Beura 👋

I am a Class 11 Student and Researcher from Odisha, India.
My work exists at the boundary where **Advanced Physics** meets **Artificial Intelligence**.

I don't just study science; I try to build it.

### 🔭 What I am Working On
* **Dimensional Memory Encoding (DME):** A theoretical framework exploring how memory data is encoded across dimensions.
* **Pollution Eating Paint:** Developing chemical compounds to neutralize air pollutants (National Science Exhibition project).
* **Visualizing the Cosmos:** Using **Three.js** and **Python** to simulate fluid dynamics (Bernoulli's Principle) and astrophysical events.

### ⚡ Technical Arsenal
* **Physics:** Thermodynamics, Fluid Dynamics, Astrophysics
* **Code:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript (Three.js), Python
* **Tools:** Gemini AI, Replit, GitHub
